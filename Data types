#C.R.I.B.S is a way to remember all the data types

#You can "cast" for data types
f#for example:
name = str(input("enter name"))
#in this code, str means we want the data entered as a string


age = int(input("enter age"))
#in this code, int means we want the data entered as a integer

price = float(input("enter price"))
#in this code, float means we want the data entered as a decimal

#This is called "casting" for data types
